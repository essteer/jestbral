      For new Chinese speakers seeking native materials to engage with, the
      volume of what is available can make difficult the process of locating
      works that suit their interests and taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effort is worthwhile. There are a wealth of contemporary artists and
      thinkers who convey deep human and social insights with awe, humour, rage,
      and sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The few novelists, essayists, and filmmakers introduced below came to me
      via friends, other language learners, or personal encounters across years
      of searching. There are many more worth spending time with.

      Chen Zhongshi 陳忠實 (1942 - 2016) was an author and the 1997 recipient of
      the Mao Dun Literature Prize 茅盾文學獎.
    </p>
    <p>
      The novel that earned him recognition, White Deer Plain 白鹿原, follows
      two rival families in rural Shaanxi province through the major upheavals
      of the first half of the 20th century. From the decline of the Qing
      Dynasty, through the establishment of the Republic of China, Japanese
      occupation and civil war, and the ultimate victory of the Communist Party,
      Chen depicts the conflicting interests and obligations that lead
      individuals to fateful decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The narrative complexity brings out the overwhelming uncertainty people
      endured during the period, and avoids any sense of a simple moral path to
      safety.

      That experience influenced some of his best-known works, including the
